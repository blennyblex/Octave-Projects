The company supplies products to 531 cities in the United State, making a total sales of 2.30M, selling to a total of 793 customers. They make an average profit of $28.66.
A line chart over time showed that an increase in sales led to a proportional increase in profit. Although the highest sales were made in November, more profit was generated in December. The least profit was generated in January, which could be a result of the aftermath of the holidays â€“ the Christmas and New Year Celebration.
A clustered bar chart showed the top 5 customers by sales and profits. It was clear that, although Sean Miller gave the top sales, such sales resulted in a loss. A suggestion on looking at how much discount is being given to such customer can be made known.
The top-selling region is the West region, the least being the South region. Among the Products category, the Technology gave the highest resulting sales, with the least being Furniture, which had no profit from it.
The Standard Class ship mode has the most profit, which could mean that most people prefer their goods being shipped with standard class.
A simple pie chart showed that the Consumer in the customer segment gave more profit. Not neglecting the Home Office which gave the lowest profit, a suggestion on ads targeting the Home office can be presented.
A table showing the total sales against the profit of the states was presented, showing that the company has some states among the top sales resulting in losses.
